Flappy Bird, the most popular and addictive game for mobile users.
Using Seta:DSP and Seta:GPU developed by Honguito98

According to Wikipedia:
```
Flappy Bird is a 2013 mobile game, developed by Vietnam-based developer Nguyễn Hà
Đông[3][4] (Dong Nguyen) and published by .GEARS Studios, a small, independent game
developer also based in Vietnam.[5] The game has a side-scrolling format and the player
controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without coming into
contact with them. The developer created the game over several days, using a bird
protagonist which he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.

The game was released on May 24, 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early
2014. It was criticized for its level of difficulty and alleged plagiarism in graphics
and game mechanics, while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014,
it was the most downloaded free game in the iOS App Store. During this period, its
developer claimed that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements.

Flappy Bird was removed from both Apple's App Store and Google Play by its creator on
February 10, 2014, due to guilt over what he considered to be its addictive nature. The
game's popularity and sudden removal caused phones with it pre-installed to be put up for
sale for high prices over the Internet.[6][7][8] Games similar to Flappy Bird became
popular on the iTunes App Store in the wake of its removal, and both Apple and Google
have removed games from their app stores for being too similar to the original. The game
has also been distributed through unofficial channels on multiple platforms.
